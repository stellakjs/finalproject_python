For this project I learned SWIFT and I noticed the similarity it had with Python. Since this was my frist time using Swift, I did a code
along from a youtube video to gain a more vivid interpetation of Swift. The difficults I faced was saving user input field so that it will 
appear even when the user exits the app. I fixed the issue by researching my situation and found a solution. Although I did'nt achieve what I had in mind, I've learned a ton and had fun while doing so. For the future I would like like to upgrade the UI and add more features.
